#### **I have never been to a hackathon before, can I still attend?**

Of course! Check out [this great post](https://forum.schoolofdata.ch/t/make-the-most-of-hackathon-season/) by [Oleg](https://datalets.ch/) about getting started with hackathons.

#### **I am not a programmer and I know nothing of electronics, can I still attend?**

Of course!! The greater the diversity of ideas, the more awesome the solutions will be!

#### **What is LoRaWAN?**

It's a wireless technology, much like your regular WiFi, but it's ideal for IoT and battery powered sensors because it has a huge range. Head over to [The Things Network](https://thethingsnetwork.org) website, and check out the *LEARN* section and the forum.

#### **What is civic tech?**

It is technology that enables citizen engagement. It means citizens building infrastructure for their city, instead of governments building it. That's what [The Things Network](https://thethingsnetwork.org) communities are doing with LoRaWAN in multiple cities of the world, among them, here in Zurich we are part of a community that has already deployed a LoRaWAN network in the city.

#### **What should I bring to the event?**

Bring your laptop and your ideas on how to improve your city!

If you want to bring your own hardware (microcontroller, sensors, etc), designs, enclosures, or whatever to help you create a solution for a challenge, feel free to do so. The kits provided are 3v3 in case you want to prepare something upfront.

#### **Do we get to keep the hardware provided?**

**Yes**.

#### **Where can I get in touch with other participants?**

If you haven't done it already, sign up for our [Slack team](https://ttn-ch.herokuapp.com). A large part of communication during the event will happen there!

#### **What is the exact schedule?**

It will be announced soon.

#### **What are my transportation options for getting to and from the event?**

We recommend to use public transport to get to the event. Kraftwerk is located only a few steps away from several stations, which are heavily connected by the train, tram and bus network.
